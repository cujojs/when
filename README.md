A lightweight [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) [Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) and `when()` implementation.  It also provides several other useful Promise-related concepts, such as joining and chaining, and has a robust unit test suite.

It's **just over 1k** when compiled with Google Closure (w/advanced optimizations) and gzipped.

when.js was derived from the async core of [wire.js](http://github.com/briancavalier/wire).

What's New?
===========

### v0.10.0

* `when.map` and `when.reduce` - just like Array.map and Array.reduce, but they operate on promises and arrays of promises
* Lots of internal size and performance optimizations
* Still only 1k!

### v0.9.4

* Important fix for break in promise chains

Examples
================

API
===

when()
------

Register a handler for a promise or immediate value:

```javascript
when(promiseOrValue, callback, errback, progressback)

// Always returns a promise, so can be chained:

when(promiseOrValue, callback, errback, progressback).then(anotherCallback, anotherErrback, anotherProgressback)
```

when.defer()
------------

Create a new Deferred containing separate `promise` and `resolver` parts:

```javascript
var deferred = when.defer();

var promise = deferred.promise;
var resolver = deferred.resolver;
```

The deferred has the full `promise` + `resolver` API:

```javascript
deferred.then(callback, errback, progressback);
deferred.resolve(value);
deferred.reject(reason);
deferred.progress(update);
```

The `promise` API:

```javascript
// var promise = deferred.promise;
promise.then(callback, errback, progressback);
```

The `resolver` API:

```javascript
// var resolver = deferred.resolver;
resolver.resolve(value);
resolver.reject(err);
resolver.progress(update);
```

when.isPromise()
----------------

```javscript
var is = when.isPromise(anything);
```

Return true if `anything` is truthy and implements the then() promise API.  Note that this will return true for both a deferred (i.e. `when.defer()`), and a `deferred.promise` since both implement the promise API.


when.some()
-----------

```javascript
when.some(promisesOrValues, howMany, callback, errback, progressback)
```

Return a promise that will resolve when `howMany` of the supplied `promisesOrValues` have resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be an array of length `howMany` containing the resolutions values of the triggering `promisesOrValues`.

when.all()
----------

```javascript
when.all(promisesOrValues, callback, errback, progressback)
```

Return a promise that will resolve only once *all* the supplied `promisesOrValues` have resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be an array containing the resolution values of each of the `promisesOrValues`.

when.any()
----------

```javascript
when.any(promisesOrValues, callback, errback, progressback)
```

Return a promise that will resolve when any one of the supplied `promisesOrValues` has resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be the resolution value of the triggering `promiseOrValue`.

when.chain()
------------

```javascript
when.chain(promiseOrValue, resolver, optionalValue)
```

Ensure that resolution of `promiseOrValue` will complete `resolver` with the completion value of `promiseOrValue`, or instead with `optionalValue` if it is provided.

Returns a new promise that will complete when `promiseOrValue` is completed, with the completion value of `promiseOrValue`, or instead with `optionalValue` if it is provided.

**Note:** If `promiseOrValue` is not an immediate value, it can be anything that supports the promise API (i.e. `then()`), so you can pass a `deferred` as well.  Similarly, `resolver` can be anything that supports the resolver API (i.e. `resolve()`, `reject()`), so a `deferred` will work there, too.

when.map()
----------

```javascript
when.map(promisesOrValues, mapFunc)
```

Traditional map function, similar to `Array.prototype.map()`, but allows input to contain promises and/or values, and mapFunc may return either a value or a promise.

The map function should have the signature:

```javascript
mapFunc(item)
```

Where:

* `item` is a fully resolved value of a promise or value in `promisesOrValues`

when.reduce()
-------------

```javascript
when.reduce(promisesOrValues, reduceFunc, initialValue)
```

Traditional reduce function, similar to `Array.prototype.reduce()`, but input may contain promises and/or values, and reduceFunc may return either a value or a promise, *and* initialValue may be a promise for the starting value.

The reduce function should have the signature:

```javascript
reduceFunc(currentValue, nextItem, index, total)
```

Where:

* `currentValue` is the current accumulated reduce value
* `nextItem` is the fully resolved value of the promise or value at `index` in `promisesOrValues`
* `index` the *basis* of `nextItem` ... practically speaking, this is the array index of the promiseOrValue corresponding to `nextItem`
* `total` is the total number of items in `promisesOrValues`

Testing
=======

To run the unit tests, first pull in the dojo.util submodule "doh" by running
`git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from the `when.js` directory.
Then open test/index.html in your web browser.
