 * cancelable.js
 *
 * Decorator that makes a deferred "cancelable".  It adds a cancel() method that
 * will call a special cancel handler function and then reject the deferred.  The
 * cancel handler can be used to do resource cleanup, or anything else that should
 * be done before any other rejection handlers are executed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * var cancelableDeferred = cancelable(when.defer(), myCancelHandler);
